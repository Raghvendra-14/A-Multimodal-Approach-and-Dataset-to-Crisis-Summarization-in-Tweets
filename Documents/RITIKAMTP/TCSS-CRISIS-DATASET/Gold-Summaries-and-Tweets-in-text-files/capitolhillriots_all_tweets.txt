BLM protests are treated like riots , police escalate shit until it eventually turns into a riot . Trump cult can raid the US Capitol while armed , with no opposition until they get unto the building . But still only a few police there to watch them and ca n't do nothing .
Why am I seeing photos of US police chatting & smiling with the thugs who have invaded US Capitol building ? Why are they not being arrested ? Where is the tear gas & riot gear ? Is it because they are white rather than black ? Trump is responsible for this . The world is watching .
